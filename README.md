👋 Hey, I’m @TauruSilv3R
👀 I’m obsessed with web dev, DevOps magic, automating all the things, and making Python dance.
🌱 Currently leveling up in AI wizardry, next-gen DevOps pipelines, and parallax sites that are smoother than your fave TikTok transition.
💞️ Let’s vibe and collab on web projects that break the internet, automation scripts that do the work for you, or the next big AI-powered app.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him, but you can call me the Code Sorcerer.
⚡ Fun fact: I can code faster than you can say ‘Gen Z,’ and I’ve got a soft spot for pixel-perfect designs and caffeine-fueled coding sprints.
